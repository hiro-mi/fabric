Known Issues & Workarounds

Previous releases included example input files for configtxgen (configtx.yaml)
that contained invalid YAML. This was discovered as we were moving to a newer
YAML parser.

While we have corrected the examples, users are advised to evaluate their
configtxgen input documents for places were YAML anchors are referenced before
they are defined. Nodes should be reordered to ensure anchors are defined
before referenced.

Please refer to https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-10151 for more
details.

There is a change how some of the indexes maintained by ledger are updated.
Specifically, this include indexes that maintain information by txid. In a rare
scenario where there are more than one transactions with same transaction ids,
in the Previous releases, the last transaction would be indexed. However, in this
release, the behaviour is changed and the first transaction will not be overwritten
in the index. See https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-8557 for more details.

This change may cause peers in a network giving different answers to the queries
that are answered using these indexes. This can happen when during upgrade when some of
the peers are still on the previous release and hence indexing transaction based on the
previous behavior. The queries that may show this effect include 'GetTransactionByID',
'GetBlockByTxID', via qscc. TODO - check whether 'GetTxValidationCodeByTxID' ledger
api is also exposed by some other mean.

As noted above that in a permissioned network, duplicate transaction ids would be a rare
situation, however, if the above mentioned different query response is observed, it can be
resolved by rebuilding the block storage indexes.
